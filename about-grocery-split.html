<h1>🛒 How to Split Grocery Expenses Fairly?</h1>

<p>
Grocery spending is a shared responsibility when people live together — roommates, friends, PG students or family groups.
But often, everyone does not contribute equally. Some buy more items, some use more items.
So it is important to calculate a fair settlement.
</p>

<h2>✅ Simple Equal Split</h2>

<p>If everyone uses groceries equally:</p>
<pre>Total Grocery Bill ÷ Number of People</pre>

<h2>⚖️ When contributions are different?</h2>

<p>
Example:  
Person A spent ₹1200  
Person B spent ₹400  
Person C spent ₹0  
Total = ₹1600  
Each share = ₹533  
</p>

<p>So final settlement:</p>

<ul>
<li>A receives ₹667</li>
<li>B pays ₹133</li>
<li>C pays ₹533</li>
</ul>
